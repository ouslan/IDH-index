# IndexIDH - Human Development Index Calculation

This Python script calculates the Human Development Index (HDI) for Puerto Rico using health, income, and education indices. The HDI is a summary measure of a nation's average achievements in three basic dimensions of human development: health, education, and income.

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, make sure you create the virtual enviroment and activate it:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/unclearcoder/IDH-index.git
cd IDH-index
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda env activate research_env
```

This will create a new conda environment with the required libraries.

## Usage

### IDH Index module

```python
from IndexIDH import IndexIDH

# Create an instance of the IndexIDH class
idh = IndexIDH()

# Calculate and save the health index
idh.health_index()

# Calculate and save the income index
idh.income_index()

# Calculate and save the education index
idh.edu_index()

# Calculate and save the overall Human Development Index
idh.idh_index()
```

### Description

- **Health Index**: Calculates the health index based on life expectancy.
- **Income Index**: Calculates the income index using Atlas GNI per capita and GNI constant.
- **Education Index**: Calculates the education index based on mean years of schooling and expected years of schooling.
- **Human Development Index (HDI)**: Combines the health, income, and education indices to calculate the overall HDI.

### fetch.py

The data retrieval module (`fetch.py`) fetches data from the following sources:

- [World Bank](https://data.worldbank.org/): Health, Income, and Education Indicators
- [GNI](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GNP.PCAP.PP.CD): GDP per Capita, GNI Constant
- [Census](https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/data/pums/): Population, Housing Units, and Income by Sex, Race, and Ethnicity for 5-Year
- [Informe del Gobernador](https://jp.pr.gov/informe-economico-al-gobernador/): GDP for Puerto Rico

## Running the Script

1. Instantiate the `IndexIDH` class.
2. Call the individual index calculation methods: `health_index`, `income_index`, `edu_index`, and `idh_index`.
3. The calculated indices are saved in the `data/processed/` folder.

## Note

- The script assumes specific data files are available in the `data/raw/` and `data/external/` folders.
- Adjustments to the calculation methodology can be made by modifying the code as needed.
